# PIDA – the app

Translation of content/de/01-pida.md. Headings carry the German article id (`{#…}`) so that both languages share ids.

## What is PIDA? {#was-ist-pida}

PIDA signs PDF documents electronically – with ID Austria and, on a computer (desktop), also with a smart card or a
keystore (PKCS#12 file). PIDA is a functionally equivalent re-implementation of PDF-Over, the PDF signing tool by
A-SIT, but without Java. PIDA is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android, and as a browser version (web
service). As with PDF-Over, signatures are created according to the PDF-AS method (signature block and profiles from
PDF-AS). PIDA is free software under the EUPL-1.2 and an open-source project by A-SIT, not an official product of the
Republic of Austria or of A-Trust GmbH.

## Signing methods {#signiermittel}

- **ID Austria** (desktop, Android, browser): signature via A-Trust. Log in with your phone number or user name and
  your signature password; confirm in the “ID Austria” app (check the reference value), by SMS TAN or, on the
  desktop, with a FIDO2 security key. Some identities (e.g. test identities) have no second factor; A-Trust then signs
  right after login. In a batch, one login is enough for all documents.
- **Smart card** (desktop only): insert the card into the reader; PIDA talks to the locally installed smart card
  software (local BKU, e.g. on port 3495), where you enter the PIN.
- **Keystore** (desktop only): select a PKCS#12 file (.p12/.pfx) under Settings › Signing methods. JKS and JCEKS
  files must first be converted to PKCS#12 (e.g. with `keytool -importkeystore`). If you like, the password can be
  remembered in the system keychain. A keystore creates an advanced signature, not a qualified one (unless the key is
  stored on a qualified signature creation device).
- On Android and in the browser, only ID Austria is available.

## Using PIDA {#bedienung}

- **Workspace:** drag a PDF in or select one – PIDA places the signature block automatically on free space. Move it
  with the mouse, your finger or the arrow keys; the block snaps to margins, below the text and into empty signature
  fields. You can also sign on a new page or invisibly (without a signature block).
- **Signature fields and QR placeholders** in the document are detected and offered as targets.
- **Batch:** several PDFs at once – log in to ID Austria once and confirm each document individually. Protected or
  damaged files are skipped.
- **Signature block:** profiles “Standard (small)”, “Official signature” and more from PDF-AS, language of the
  signature block (German/English), your own emblem (default: the PIDA seal), note text – with a preview under
  Settings › Signature block.
- **PDF/A:** PDF/A documents are signed in a PDF/A-compliant way.
- **Done:** after signing, PIDA shows the result; “Open”, “Show in folder” (desktop), “Share” (Android) or “Download”
  (browser). “Recently signed” lists the latest documents (can be switched off).
- German and English, light and dark theme, command palette (⌘K or Ctrl+K), fully usable with the keyboard.
- **Switching from PDF-Over:** on first start, PIDA offers to take over the settings from PDF-Over. The PDF-Over
  start arguments keep working; in addition there is the command line `pida-cli`.

## Signature level and verification {#signaturniveau-und-prufung}

- PIDA creates signatures according to the PDF-AS method at the level PAdES-B-B: without a timestamp, without
  long-term validation data (DSS/LTV) and without certification (DocMDP).
- With ID Austria, the result is a qualified electronic signature (A-Trust is a qualified trust service provider).
- PIDA checks every new signature itself before saving (document unchanged, signature cryptographically intact) and
  only saves if this self-check succeeds. PIDA does not check the certificate's chain of trust or revocation status –
  use the signature verification at www.signaturpruefung.gv.at for that.

## Privacy {#datenschutz}

- **ID Austria:** for signing, the PDF document is sent to A-Trust (see A-Trust's privacy policy). A connection is only
  made once you explicitly start signing.
- **Smart card and keystore:** signing happens on your own device; the document is not uploaded.
- Settings, “Recently signed” and logs stay on the device. Logs contain no passwords, TANs or document contents.
- **Update check (desktop):** at most once a day, PIDA asks GitHub for the latest version; this can be switched off
  under Settings › Advanced.
- **Browser version:** documents and settings are not stored and are gone once you close the page. For ID Austria,
  PIDA shows the real A-Trust page in a window above the app; you enter your credentials directly at A-Trust. The
  document passes through the PIDA server – in memory only.

## Installation (short version) {#installation-kurzfassung}

- **Windows:** installer `…-setup.exe` (or `.msi` for managed installations, `…-portable.zip` without installation).
  SmartScreen warns because the installer is not code-signed: “More info” › “Run anyway”.
- **macOS:** open the `.dmg`, drag PIDA into “Applications”. The app is not notarised: up to macOS 14, right-click ›
  “Open”; from macOS 15, System Settings › Privacy & Security › “Open Anyway”.
- **Linux:** `.deb` (Debian, Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora, RHEL) or AppImage.
- **Android:** download the `.apk` and allow installation from unknown sources.
- An iOS version is not part of the releases. The packages do not update themselves.

## Command line pida-cli {#kommandozeile-pida-cli}

`pida-cli` understands the PDF-Over start arguments (`-i -o -b -n -p -ks -kspass -ksalias -a -s -c -v` …) and adds
commands such as `verify` (self-check of a file), `profiles`, `migrate --dry-run`, `licenses`, as well as
`--headless` (no prompts) and `--json`. Examples:

- `pida-cli contract.pdf -b MOBILE` – sign with ID Austria, prompts in the terminal
- `pida-cli sign ./invoices -b KS -ks certificate.p12 --kspass-env PIDA_KSPASS -a -o ./signed --headless` – sign a
  whole folder with a keystore, password from an environment variable, automatic position, output to `./signed`,
  no prompts
- `pida-cli verify contract_signed.pdf` – self-check (without chain of trust and revocation status)
- `pida-cli --help` – all options and exit codes
