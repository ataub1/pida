### PIDA – texts of the new user interface, UI-A (shell, start, workspace, signing card, done, batch), English (EUPL-1.2)
###
### Maintained by hand (ADR 0004 §4.5). IDs: `ng-ui-<area>-<name>`, areas of this file:
### shell, start, ws, insp, sc, fin, batch. All catalogs of a language form one Fluent bundle: do not reuse an ID from
### `pida.ftl`, `pdfover.ftl` or the other `ui-*.ftl`; every ID with the same variables in
### `de/` and `en/` (test `crates/i18n/tests/catalogs.rs`). Singular/plural via selectors.
###
### Texts from the prototype (`prototypes/pida-workspace/src/i18n/en.ts`), adapted to the core: wording per
### ADR 0004 §8 F3 – never “valid” or “legally valid”, but “Signature created and checked (self-check)” and
### “according to the certificate”; keyboard steps as in the core (15/1/50 pt).
