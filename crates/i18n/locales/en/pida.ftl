### PIDA – own texts, English (EUPL-1.2)
###
### Maintained by hand. Every ID needs an entry in `de/` and `en/` with the same variables
### (test `crates/i18n/tests/code_catalog.rs`). Two kinds of IDs:
###
### - Own texts (package E and UI): prefix `ng-`, so they never collide with the IDs generated from
###   PDF-Over (`pdfover.ftl`).
### - Stable codes of the crates (ADR 0001 rule 11, plan §7.5): the ID is the code itself
###   (`cms-der`, `backend-network`, `fido2-timeout` …). Codes with a dot (`render.failed`,
###   `placement.notice.clamped`) are not valid in Fluent; their ID is derived like the PDF-Over keys
###   with `pida_i18n::fluent_id_for_java_key` (dot → hyphen: `render-failed`,
###   `placement-notice-clamped`).
###
### Variables are named after the fields of the error variant (`$detail` for free text). The test
### checks that every code produced by the sources (`fn code`, `fn message_id`, `NOTICE_*`, code
### literals) is present here in both languages.
